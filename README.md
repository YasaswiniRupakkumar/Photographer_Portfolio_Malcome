# Photographer Portfolio Website

This is my first web development project, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It serves as a portfolio website for a photographer and was a great learning experience in web design and development.

## Features
- Interactive UI elements
- Clean and minimalistic layout

## Requirements
This project is designed to run on **XAMPP**.

## How to Run Locally
1. **Download and Install XAMPP** (if not already installed). You can get it from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/).
2. **Start Apache Server** in the XAMPP Control Panel.
3. **Move the Project Files**
   - Copy the project folder into the `htdocs` directory inside the XAMPP installation folder.
4. **Run the Website**
   - Open your browser and go to:  
     `http://localhost/{your-project-folder}/home_page.html`

## Feedback
Since this is my first web project, any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome! ðŸš€
